        <h2>The most important consideration when planning a visit to Petra is time</h2>
        <p>
                With 2,640 acres in the Petra Archaeologic Park itself, there is much to see and with few exceptions you are free to explore everything at your leisure and will.  The local people all agree--to properly and fully explore you need five days minimum.  While there is certainly enough to occupy yourself for five or more days, two to three days is sufficient to visit all of the highlights in and around the park.  One day--or worse yet a morning or afternoon--is likely to bring some disappointment to those who have traveled a great distance.  If at all possible, plan for two full days as an absolute minimum.
                
                A day trip to Petra from Amman, is possible either by taxi or bus, but again you are likely to be disappointed and frustrated by having so much to see and do with so little time.
                
                The modern town just outside the ancient city (population about 30,000) is the home for most Jordanian tour agencies.  They can arrange for tours of any size and for any reasonable budget.  Much of the local population is involved, directly or indirectly, with tourism.  While only official, certified guides can be hired inside of ancient Petra (and all other official sights in Jordan), agencies (or you) can hire guides for other purposes such as camping, hiking, backpacking, horse/camel excursions, etc.  As always, a reputable agency is the safest and most certain route to plan such adventures far from your home (or country).  The people are genuinely friendly and violent crime is nearly non-existent in this HIGHLY family-oriented area.
